Users will be able to use GET routes, POST routes, PUT routes, and DELETE routes to see and update the database. Currently it is only available to be fully used on Insomnia or other related apps but it is ready for a front end for real world application.## InstallationIn order to install this application, go to the corresponding GitHub Repo, located on my page titled: ecommerce-store and download the zip file. Using the terminal navigate to the correct folder and type 'npm start' and the server will start. Once the server has started, open Insomnia Core (or another related software) and use all the routes!## InstructionsThis application is meant for any back-end ecommerce store of any size for you to organize all your inventory. Once the front end is complete you will be able to see your stock, add stock, update stock and even delete items you no longer need.## License  MIT License.  Link: https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html  ## ContributionPlease contribute by adding a front end, I'm in desperate need.## TestingBy downloading it, and using Insomnia Core to test all the different routes.## GitHubhttps://github.com/baumerr
